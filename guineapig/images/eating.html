	<h2>5 Eating</h2>
	
			<h3>5.1	24/7 non-negotiable</h3>
			
		
		<hr  />
<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/clock.png" alt="24/7 food"/> <br/>
Proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and water are necessary nutrients. <br/><br/>
	
In order to achieve optimal performance, three (3) things must be <strong>available 24/7</strong> for your guinea pig:
	
	<ul class="good">
	  <li> Water
<li> Grass Hay
<li>Pellets (lower priority than hay and water)

	</ul>
	
	Also, it is highly recommended to provide your guinea pig with the following:
	<ul class="good">
<li> Vegetables
<li> Fruits
<li>Vitamin C <em>(through natural food)</em>
	</ul>
	<span class="bitno">NOTE:</span> Guinea pigs have a sensitive digestive system which is easily upset. Always introduce new foods slowly and patiently. Begin with a very small piece, and if they like it, keep increasing the amount a little for the next serving.<br/>
<br/>Refrain yourself from stuffing food in their mouth by force, because you might think they would LOVE it if they just TRY it. It is hard to believe, but they know what they want.
	
<h3>5.2 Water	</h3>
<hr  />
<br/>

<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/guinea-pig-drip_bottle.png" alt="Guinea Pig Water">
<br/>
	Guinea Pigs require constant supply of <span class="good">clean, daily fresh, room-temperature plain water</span> for optimal performance.<br/><br/>
	<span class="bad">! Avoid distilled water </span>(it does not provide minerals that are essential to important body functions).<br/><br/>
	<span class="bad">! Avoid water high in minerals</span> (especially calcium).<br/><br/>
	<span class="bad">! Avoid putting medications, vitamins or any other supplements in water.</span><br/><br/>
	<strong>Untreated tap water</strong> is usually not recommended (possibility of chlorine and heavy metal contamination), but this depends on the quality of your home water distribution which can be tested.<br/><br/>
	<strong>Unflavored bottled</strong> drinking water or fresh spring water is recommended.<br/><br/>
	Provide water in a <strong>cage-mounted drip bottle</strong> (to prevent contamination and/or spilling, which is usual for dish servings).<br/><br/>
	<strong>Clean the drip bottle nozzle frequently</strong> (hay and pellet gunk can breed harmful bacteria and clog the water flow if not cleaned regularly).


<h3>5.3 Hay</h3>
<hr  />

<br/>

<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/hay.png" alt="Guinea Pig Hay">
<br/><br/>	

Guinea pigs are <strong>grazing animals</strong>. <br/>It is highly recommended to provide your guinea pig with <strong class="good">unlimited amounts of grass hay</strong>, primarily for three reasons:<br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li>	Guinea Pigs teeth are <strong class="bitno">continually growing</strong> so they need to be constantly grazing and grinding (hay) to prevent teeth from over growing.
  <li>	Eating the long hay strands keeps their <strong class="bitno">digestive system</strong> moving and in good health.
  <li>	Hay does not contribute significantly to obesity as it is a modest source of protein and nutrients.
  </ol>
	<strong class="bitno">NOTE:</strong> <em>Pellets are not a substitute for hay.</em> Lack of hay can lead to misalignment of the teeth that may require surgical correction, and gastrointestinal stasis - shutting down of the digestive tract which often leads to guinea pig <strong>death</strong>.<br/><br/>


<h3>5.4 Pellets</h3>
<hr  />

<br/>

<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/guinea-pig-pellets.png" alt="Guinea Pig Pellets">
<br/><br/>		
		
	
	<span class="good">Not inevitable as hay or water</span>, but plays a major roll in providing needed nutrients.<br/><br/>
	Provide your guinea pig with about &#188; - &#8539; cup of plain, <span class="bad">dye free </span>guinea pig pellets for eating.<br/><br/>
	You can serve it in a small, relatively <strong>heavy ceramic bowl</strong> (to prevent tipping).<br/><br/>
	It is recommended to buy pellets formulated with <span class="good">vitamin C.</span><br/><br/>
	Store pellets in a dry, cool, dark place to preserve the potency of the vitamin C.<br/><br/>
	Always look on for an <span class="bad">expiration date </span>to insure product freshness.<br/><br/>
	Avoid pellets that use <span class="bad">animal byproducts </span>and those whose primary ingredient is <span class="bad">corn.</span><br/><br/>
	<span class="bad">Do not feed other small animal pellets</span> (like rabbit pellets) because the vitamin content is not the same, and can be harmful to your guinea pig.<br/><br/>
	To prevent <span class="bad">selective eating and junk chemicals</span>, the boring, grayscale pellets are preferred over the funny colorful ones.


<h3>5.5 Vegetables</h3>
<hr  />

<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/greenleaflettuce.png" alt="Guinea Pig Vegetables">		
<br/><br/>
	Feed your guinea pig primarily <span class="good">green leafy vegetables.</span><br/><br/>
	Some vegetables can be provided few times a day, some few times a week. Read subcategories for more info.<br/><br/>
	It is recommended to remove uneaten vegetables to prevent <span class="bad">spoiling/rotting.</span><br/><br/>
	Do not feed <span class="bad">wilted or spoiled food.</span><br/><br/>
	Don't feed your guinea pig everyday the same vegetables - <span class="good">Variety </span>is the key to maintaining guinea pigs health.<br/><br/>
	Be cautious about vegetables from the freezer - if food is <span class="bad">too cold</span>, guinea pigs can get diarrhea.<br/><br/>

	<em>NOT recommended</em>: <span class="bad">iceberg</span> (high in nitrates and low in nutrients, can cause diarrhea if given in excess).<br/><br/>
	<em>NOT recommended</em>: any vegetable in the <span class="bad">cabbage family</span> (it won't kill them, but could cause bloat if feeding continuously), or <span class="bad">beet greens</span> (too high in oxalates).<br/><br/>



	
<br/>
<b>Vegetables that guinea pigs can eat everyday:</b>

<br/>

<ul class="checklist">

<li>	<span class="good">Cucumber:</span> Little nutritional value, but high water content - especially appreciated in summer.
<li>	<span class="good">Bell Peppers:</span> Green/Red/Yellow/Orange  (red yellow and orange are high in calcium, so limit those. <span class="bad">Remove seeds</span>).
<li>	<span class="good">Carrots:</span> Both the root and the green tops are recommended (BUT take note that <span class="bad">high sugar and Vitamin A</span> content require moderate consumption).
<li>	<span class="good">Leafy greens:</span><ul>
<li>	Green leaf lettuce
<li>	Cilantro
<li>	Red leaf lettuce
<li>	Escarole
<li>	Swiss chard
<li>	Curly endive
</ul>
</ul>



<br/>
<b>Vegetables that guinea pigs can eat occasionally</b><br/> <em>(few times a week)</em>:</p>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>	<strong>Romaine</strong> (<span class="bad">only small amounts recommended </span>- it has a poor calcium/phosphorus ratio that can cause kidney stone problems).
<li>	<strong>Spinach</strong> (<span class="bad">small amounts recommended </span>to avoid potential kidney stone problems).
<li>	<strong>Broccoli</strong> leaves and peeled broccoli stem: Related to the <span class="bad">cabbage family</span>, so small doses recommended.
<li>	<strong>Cauliflower: </strong>Related to the <span class="bad">cabbage family</span>, so small doses recommended.
<li>	<strong>Kale:</strong> Related to the <span class="bad">cabbage family</span>, so small doses recommended.
<li>	<strong>Chinese Cabbage/pak-choi:</strong> Related to the <span class="bad">cabbage family</span>, so small doses recommended.
<li>	<strong>Corn silks and husks:</strong> When in season.
<li>	<strong>Parsley:</strong> Very high in calcium, so caution is recommended if guinea pig is prone to developing bladder stones.
<li>	<strong>Forages</strong> like chickweed, dandelions, and young clover.
<li>	<strong>Celery:</strong> <span class="bad">Cut into small pieces</span> as it is very stringy, to avoid guinea pig choking.
<li>	<strong>Fresh Grass:</strong> Clean, pesticide-free, <span class="bad">not soiled by dogs/cats/etc, NOT cut by a lawn mower.</span>
<li>	<strong>Tomato:</strong> Remove the <span class="bad">poisonous tomato top</span> (green part). Remove seeds if using a slice from a larger tomato.
<li>	<strong>Beetroot: </strong>Recommended in raw form rather than pickled. High in antioxidants and other nutrients. Feeding too often may result in red urine.


  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>5.6 Fruits</h3>
<hr/>
<br/>
<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/apple.png" alt="Guinea Pig Apple">
<br/><br/>  
		<span class="bad">NOTE:</span> Many fruits are full of natural sugar, contain fruit acid and possible low Ca:P ratio, which could lead to bladder problems. Cut the fruits to small pieces to avoid mouth soreness.
		<br/><br/><strong class="bitno">! Fruits must be provided occasionally, as a treat.</strong>
		<br/><br/>

<em>Following fruits are recommended for occasional consumption:</em></p>

<ul class="checklist">
<li>	<strong>Apple:</strong> Thin wedge, include peel, <span class="bad">REMOVE SEEDS</span> which contain cyanide compound.
<li>	<strong>Pear:</strong> Thin wedge, include peel. Remove seeds.
<li>	<strong>Apricot:</strong> Dried, a couple small pieces.
<li>	<strong>Banana:</strong> Relatively low in vitamin C but rich in other nutrients.
<li>	<strong>Blueberries</strong>
<li>	<strong>Cantaloupe</strong>
<li>	<strong>Seedless Grapes or Raisins:</strong> <span class="bad">NOT BOTH</span>, and very sparingly.
<li>	<strong>Orange</strong>
<li>	<strong>Strawberries:</strong> Another popular summer fruit, also very high in vitamin C.
<li>	<strong>Watermelon</strong>
<li>	<strong>Cranberries</strong>: very high in vitamin C; too much can cause <span class="bad">STOMACH UPSET.</span>
<li>	<strong>Grapefruit</strong>: Pink, red, and white varieties are all good sources of vitamin C, but they can be too sour for some pigs. They are high in WATER content so are refreshing in warm weather.
<li><strong>	Kiwi</strong>: Extremely high in vitamin C and considered very good for cavies.
<li>	<strong>Mango</strong>: High water content makes it very refreshing.
<li>	<strong>Raspberries</strong>: Some guinea pigs find these too tart to eat; others love them.
</ul>

<h3">5.7 Vitamin C</h3>
<hr/>
<br/>
<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-eat/kiwi.png" alt="Guinea Pig Kiwi">
<br/><br/> 
Guinea pigs are, like humans, one of the very few mammals who <span class="bitno">can't make their own vitamin C</span>, so they need to get it from their food and food supplements (latter not recommended) .
<br/><br/> 
Guinea Pigs are highly prone to getting <span class="bad">scurvy and loss of resistance</span> to other diseases, which is a disease caused by low levels of Vitamin C.
<ul class="checklist">
<li>	Guinea pigs need <span class="good">10 to 30 mg/kg or more of Vitamin C daily.</span>
<li>	<span class="bad">Water drops and tang </span>are not recommended (can even make cavies stop drinking water if they dislike the taste).
<li>	It is possible (depends on the many unique factors) that they receive adequate vitamin C from fresh vegetables and pellets, but not reliable.
</ul>
<span class="bad">! NOTE: Multivitamins are NOT recommended.</span> Excessive amounts of fat soluble vitamins like A and D can cause serious problems for your guinea pig.
<br/>
