			<h3>3.1	Good choices</h3>
		

<hr  />
		<h4>1. Wood Products</h4>  		
		<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-bedd/pine_shavings.gif" alt="Pine shavings"/><br/><br/><br/>

			<strong class="bitno">Aspen shavings:</strong> more expensive than pine shavings, possibly more difficult to find. 
<br/><br/><em>Primal decision factor:</em> Aspen shavings are without volatile OILS.<br/><br/><br/>
			<strong class="bitno">Pine shavings:</strong>  economical bedding material. 
<br/><br/><em>Primal decision factor:</em> Pine shavings contain volatile oils, for which some owners believe that may harm the guinea pig's liver or respiratory system when using for a prolonged period of time. 
<br/><br/>It is recommended to open the shavings' bag and disperse the shavings in some open container - after several days volatile oils should dissipate. If the pine smell is strong, then there is a considerable amount of volatile oils still present.<br/><br/><br/>
			<strong class="bitno">Wood pellets:</strong>  economical bedding material, but more difficult to obtain. 
<br/><br/><em>The good:</em> odor preventing and easiness of use. 
<br/><br/><em>The bad:</em> it is possible that pellets are hard to walk on for a guinea pig. It is recommended to use another bedding material in complement to make walking more comfortable.<br/><br/>


		
		<h4>2. Hay</h4>  		
		
			Economical natural product. <strong class="bitno">Not recommended to use as the only bedding material </strong>(not absorbent and requires everyday removal/replacement).<br/><br/>

	
		
		<h4>3. Cotton cloth, cotton fleece, towels</h4>  		
		
			Absorbent, soft, reusable. May require <strong class="bitno">daily cleaning or replacement.</strong><br/><br/>


		
		<h4>4. Polyester fleece</h4>  		
		
			Soft, allows fluids to drain through, reusable. <strong class="bitno">Not absorbent.</strong> May require daily cleaning or replacement.<br/><br/>

	
		
		<h4>5. Paper</h4>  		
		
			Economical, available, absorbent and provides warm flooring background for other complement bedding materials (like shavings). It makes cleaning easier (owner can just roll up the bedding and throw it away). Owner could be concerned about <strong class="bitno">printed ink toxicity.</strong><br/><br/>

	
		
		<h4 class="good">! Our recommendation: Material Combining</h4>  		
		
			<strong>1<sup>st</sup></strong> layer: <strong class="bitno">Paper</strong> for warmer flooring and easier cleaning<br/><br/>
			<strong>2<sup>nd</sup></strong> layer: <strong class="bitno">Shavings</strong> for absorption and softness<br/><br/>
			<strong>3<sup>rd</sup></strong> layer: <strong class="bitno">Hay</strong> for burrowing, sleeping arrangements, eating and to prevent shavings from flying around<br/><br/>


	<h3>3.3	Bad choices</h3>
	<hr/>

	<em>Following materials are NOT recommended for use. Here is some random picture of a skull to further emphasize this statement: </em> <br/><br/>
	<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-bedd/skull.gif" alt="Bad bedding choices"/><br/><br/>

			<h4 class="bad">! Cedar</h4>  		
				Possible negative affect on health because of the contained aromatic oils. Could cause harm to the guinea pig's respiratory tract and liver.
	<h4 class="bad">	! Corncob </h4>  		Does not eliminate odors and it has a high tendency to mold. Not suitable for walking on because it is hard on guinea pig's feet. Guinea pig can also eat corn cobs, which swell in digestive tract when wet and cause blockages. It is possible that corn cob bedding contributes to impaction problems in males.
	<h4 class="bad">	! Straw </h4>  		Non absorbent and can mold easily. Risk of serious injuries because of the stiffness.
	<h4 class="bad">	! Sawdust </h4>  		Fine particles could be inhaled and cause problems to guinea pig's respiratory system.
	<h4 class="bad">	! Plastic wire floors</h4>  		 Serious risk of injuries.
