<strong class="good">Operating within normal parameters:</strong>
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>	The normal respiration rate for a cavy is about 80 per minute.

<h3>6.9 Water drinking</h3>

<hr id="start" />
<br/>
<strong class="good">Operating within normal parameters:</strong>
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>	Water consumption differs for each cavy.
  <li>	Consumption is dependent on several factors:  temperature (during summer, water consumption is naturally higher), taste of water, activity, and preference.
  <li>	Guinea pig extracts water from vegetable matter. For this reason it may appear that guinea pig drinks very little during the day.
  <li>	If concerned, owner can check for signs of dehydration.</ul>

<br/>
<strong class="bad">CAUTION:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>	Drinking <strong>a lot more than normal</strong> (if taking weather temperature into consideration): It would be wise to have your guinea pig checked for diabetes.

<ol>
  <li>	Diabetes
  <li>	Kidney failure
  <li>	Pain
  <li>	Hunger</ol>

<br/><br/>

<span class="good">INFO<br/> </span>Guinea pigs excrete <strong>2 different types of feces:</strong> one which contains "normal" waste, and second which is produced in the animal's cecum and is called caecotroph (also called cecotrope or night feces).
<br/><br/><strong>Technically, caecotrophs are not a poop;</strong> they contain vitamins, minerals and some proteins that were not absorbed when firstly ingested and are reingested by the animal. They are usually greenish in color, but this is not a general rule.


<br/><br/><br/>
<strong class="good">Operating within normal parameters:</strong>
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>	Uniform and oval, medium to dark brown
  <li>	When begin to dry out, droppings turn black

<hr id="start" />


<br/>
<strong class="good">Operating within normal parameters:</strong>
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>	Color clear to cloudy
  <li>	Cloudiness is caused by calcium compounds in the urine. It is recommended to rub the dried calcium deposits between the fingers to determine if deposits are <strong>powdery or gritty</strong>. Check the CAUTION section.
  <li>	Very young guinea pigs often have an orange or brown tint.
  </ul>
<br/>

<strong class="bad">CAUTION:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>	<strong>Strong smelling urine</strong>: Possible dehydration or infection.
  <li>	<strong>Gritty</strong> compounds (feels coarse and sandy): Possible sludge in the bladder.
  <li>	<strong>Blood</strong> in urine: Possible urinary tract infection, bladder stones, or reproductive problems like pyometra (in females). To check for blood, put some light colored towels on the cage floor.
  <li>	<strong>Incontinence</strong> (unable to urinate): Possible bladder stones.
  </ul>
<span class="bad">NOTE:</span> Guinea pig's hair should be relatively dry, but if it is constantly wet, there is a possibility of a urinary tract infection.

<br/><br/>

<span class="good">HEALTH TIP #1: Observation<br/></span>
Know your pet. Unusual behavior patterns could mean something is wrong and symptoms could worsen very quickly. If some of the symptoms from Guinea Pig Manual is recognized, <strong>consult your veterinarian immediately</strong>.
  <br/><br/>

<br/><span class="good">HEALTH TIP #2: Weigh Your Healthy Guinea Pig Weekly<br/></span>
Weighing is one of the best, simplest and cheapest tools available for<strong> monitoring small animal's health</strong>. Owner must be aware for dramatic changes in weight.  Small fluctuations from day to day are normal. Pattern of weight loss is a reason to be alert.
  </p>
<em>Reference weight fluctuations:</em><strong>
  </strong><ul>
    <li>	1 ounce (~ <strong>28 grams</strong>) weight fluctuation: <strong class="good">OK</strong>
    <li>	2 ounces (~ <strong>57 grams</strong>) weight fluctuation: <strong style="color: #ff9900;">Alert</strong>
    <li>	3 ounces (~ <strong>85 grams</strong>) weight fluctuation: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red Alert</span>
    <li>	4 ounces (~ <strong>113 grams</strong>) weight fluctuation: <strong class="bad">Get your guinea pig to a vet!</strong>

<br/><span class="good">HEALTH TIP #3: Weigh Your <strong class="bad">Ill</strong> Guinea Pig Daily</span>
 <br/><br/>

<br/><span class="good">HEALTH TIP #4: Prevent the Spread Of Illness And Parasites by Quarantine</span>

<br/><br/>
<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-health/guinea_pig-quarantine.gif" alt="Guinea Pig Quarantine">
<br/>

It is recommended that <strong>any new guinea pig</strong> which is about to be introduced to a resident guinea pig is submitted to a quarantine procedure.</p>
The quarantine insures that the new guinea pig does not introduce any <strong>illness or parasites</strong> to the resident guinea pig(s).</p>
It is recommended to quarantine new guinea pig for <strong>2 to 3 weeks.</strong></p>
Owner is advised to <strong>wash hands</strong> well in between handling the new and the resident guinea pig and consider changing shirt or wearing a removable cover-up when handling the new (or sick) guinea pig.</p>
Quarantine procedure is specifically recommended if new guinea pig is bought in a <strong>pet store</strong> (in countries where pet stores have a bad reputation).</p>
