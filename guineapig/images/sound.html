		<h3>2.1	Good sounds</h3>
		<hr/>
			

		<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-sounds/good.png" alt="Good Sounds"/>
		<em>Good Sounds: You are doing it right! :) </em><br/><br/>

		

		<h4>Wheeking</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="guineapigmanual-wheeking2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
		
			
	Common vocalization generally communicating <strong class="bitno"><em>anticipation</em> and <em>excitement</em></strong>, particularly about being fed, or in response to the presence of its owner. <br/><br/>
	Wheeking is considered to be a form of begging, in some cases mostly heard in the morning and the evening (associated with feeding time). <br/><br/>
	Sometimes it serves as a call for an attention as they frequently call to their human slaves. <br/><br/>
One can often hear this sound when owner opens refrigerator or is rustling with plastic bags which guinea pig usually links to <em>food source. </em><br/><br/>

		
		<h4>Bubbling or Purring</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="GuineaPigManual-bubbling_purring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
		

			Cavy is <strong class="bitno"><em>enjoying itself/being happy </em></strong>(e.g. when being petted or held). <br/><br/>
			Can be also produced when given food, grooming, or crawling around to investigate a new place. <br/><br/>
			<strong class="bad">NOTE:</strong> Beware of the purring pitch and body language which complements this guinea pig sound category and could change original meaning (if the purr is higher pitched toward the end, and your pet seems to vibrate and tense, this could be interpreted as a <strong class="bitno"><em>sound of annoyance</em></strong>). <br/><br/>


		
		<h4>Grazing</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="guineapigmanual-grazing.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
		
			Calming, relaxing sound of <strong class="bitno"><em>guinea pig grazing hay.</em></strong><br/><br/>
			Noise of spreading hay around with the animal's front feet can be heard in the background.<br/><br/>
			<strong class="bitno">TIP:</strong> Before going to work, provide your pet with fresh dose of hay, put the cage near you and enjoy morning meditation :)<br/><br/>


		<h4>Chirping</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="GuineaPigManual-chirping.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
		
		
			Possibly the <strong class="bitno"><em>least understood or heard </em></strong> guinea pig sound.<br/><br/>
			Sound pattern similar to bird song.<br/><br/>
			Could be related to guinea pig messing with you.<br/><br/>

		
		<h4>Beer please</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="R2D2-can-I-have-a-beer-please.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
	
			This sound has nothing to do with what you think it has to do.<br/><br/>
			Loosely translated, it means <strong class="bitno"><em>"Can I have some beer please!"</em></strong><br/><br/>
			It is often heard when putting the guinea pig on the <em>starfighter in space-battle situations</em>.<br/><br/>
			It is reported that complying with this translation saves the owner some fingers.<br/><br/>
			<strong class="bad">NOTE: </strong>It is NEVER recommended to give your guinea pig a beer if not on the starfighter in space-battle setting.<br/><br/>

		<h3>2.2	Bad sounds</h3>
		<hr/>

		<img src="https://iop883684.github.io/guinepig/images/slike-sounds/bad.png" alt="Bad Sounds"/>
		<em>Bad sounds: You are about to lose a finger (or two).</em><br/><br/>

		<h4>Rumbling</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="GuineaPigManual-rumbling.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
		
		
		
			Sounds like purring, only lower pitched (deeper) and accompanied with vibrating.
			<br/><br/>	Response to being <strong class="bitno"><em>scared or angry </em></strong>in which case the rumble often sounds higher and the body vibrates shortly
			<br/><br/>	Also related to <strong class="bitno"><em>dominance </em></strong>within a group.
			<br/><br/>	Petting in the <strong class="bitno"><em>wrong spots </em></strong>(for instance, on your pet's underside) often results in low rumbling sound.<br/><br/>
		

		<h4>Whining</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="GuineaPigManual-chutting_whining.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
				
		
				Used to communicate <strong class="bitno"><em>annoyance </em></strong>or dislike for something an owner or another guinea pig is doing.<br/><br/>
				Can be heard in <strong class="bitno"><em>pursuit situations </em></strong>(both the pursuer and the pursuee).<br/><br/>

	
		<h4>Fight-or-flight</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="guineapigmanual-teritory_defense-bite.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
				
		
		
			If you hear this sound, it could already be too late - you probably already took a hit :)<br/><br/>
				Usually accompanied by <em>teeth chattering </em>(see previous), in some cases this sound represents the animal <strong class="bitno"><em>defending itself </em></strong>(usually from inside the hiding place), sometimes when tempering with the food or bedding in its near proximity.<br/><br/>
			In other cases, it could be heard while the animal is escaping, in reaction to <em>perceived sudden danger.</em><br/><br/>
				Shortly after producing this sound, usually follows the strike - the animal is reaching out with its head from its hiding place in a short burst, trying to hit "the enemy" with its teeth.<br/><br/>
				Owners are advised to respect the pet's private quarters and to stay calm if getting bitten - in no circumstances should one hit the animal or yell at it.<br/><br/>
				Our research suggests that this kind of guinea pig behavior is not very common. But it happens.<br/><br/>

		<h4>Squealing or shrieking</h4>
		<audio controls>
		  <source src="GuineaPigManual-squealing_shrieking.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
		</audio>
		<br><br>
				
		
				A high-pitched noise of discontent, <strong class="bitno"><em>pain and/or fear.</em></strong><br/><br/>
				Response to <strong class="bitno"><em>pain or immediate danger.</em></STRONG><br/><br/>
				<span class="bad">! URGENT NOTE:</span> Check on your pet ASAP to make sure everything is okay!
